# Contributing to archtest

archtest is a tool for AI agents, and contributions should work the same way. Your AI agent should be able to discover how to contribute, write the code, and submit a PR that another AI agent can review.

For full contribution guidelines, checklists, and PR requirements — ask the tool:

```
npx archtest contribute
```

For a pre-PR self-check:

```
npx archtest contribute --check
```

The tool is the authoritative source. This file intentionally stays thin.
